# Overview

This is a choose your own adventure game built in Rust. It uses loops, enums, and functions in Rust. 
The purpose of this project was to learn a language on my own and get a basic grasp on the program.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
